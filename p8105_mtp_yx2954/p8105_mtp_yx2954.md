# Problem 1

Goal: take a look on the trend of home value across US and rent within
NYC from three raw dataset:

- zhvi_df: ZIP code level house price in each month of 2023
- zori_df: ZIP code level rent in each month between January 2015 and
  August 2024
- zip_df: neighborhood to which each ZIP code attaches

First tidy NYC rental data to make all prices in a single column, the
clean the column names.

``` r
zori_df = read_csv("data/Zillow/Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(cols = "2015-01-31":"2024-08-31",
               names_to = "date",
               values_to = "rent") |>
  mutate(date = as.Date(date), 
         zip = RegionName)|>
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

Create a new column to store the corresponding borough name according to
the county name, and clean variable name.

``` r
url = "https://p8105.com/data/zip_codes.html"
zip_list = read_html(url) |>
  html_table() 

zip_df = 
  zip_list[[1]] |>
  mutate(borough = case_when(
    County == "New York" ~ "Manhattan",
    County == "Kings" ~ "Brooklyn",
    County == "Queens" ~ "Queens",
    County == "Bronx" ~ "Bronx",
    County == "Richmond" ~ "Staten Island")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

Duplicate Zip codes are identified

``` r
duplicate_zip = 
  zip_df |>
  filter(duplicated(zip_code))
```

``` r
duplicate1 = 
  zip_df |>
  filter(zip_code == "10463")

duplicate1
```

    ## # ℹ 1 more variable: borough <chr>

We know Kingsbridge and Northwest Brooklyn are not in Manhattan. Remove
the error row for quality control

``` r
zip_final_df = 
  zip_df |> 
  filter(!(borough == "Manhattan" & zip_code == "11201")) |>
  filter(!(borough == "Manhattan" & zip_code == "10463")) 
```

Then merge two date set and only keep neccessary columns

``` r
zori_final_df = left_join(zori_df, zip_final_df, by = c("region_name" = "zip_code")) |>
  select(-size_rank, -region_id, -region_name:-county_name, -county:-file_date) 
```

``` r
uni_zip = zori_final_df |>
  pull(zip) |>
  n_distinct()

uni_nbh = zori_final_df |>
  pull(neighborhood) |>
  n_distinct()
```

After tidy and clean the dataset, there are **17284** total observations
exist. **149** unique ZIP codes. **43** unique neighborhoods

First put all housing prices across time in a single column, then clean
column name into lower cases with underscore marks, and keep minimal
number of variables needed.

``` r
zhvi_df = read_csv("data/Zillow/Zip_zhvi_uc_sfrcondo_tier_0.33_0.67_sm_sa_month_2023.csv") |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("2023"),
    names_to = "date",
    values_to = "price"
  ) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(zip = region_name,
           date = as.Date(date)) |>
  select(-size_rank, -region_id, -region_name, -region_type, -state_name, -metro: -county_name) 

head(zhvi_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 5
    ##   state city  date         price zip  
    ##   <chr> <chr> <date>       <dbl> <chr>

    ## 6 TX    Katy  2023-06-30 483795. 77494

# Problem 2

Not all ZIP codes has 116 observations. Because some house were not
being rent in some period and some may still under construction

``` r
zori_nzip = 
  zori_df |>
  pull(zip) |>
  n_distinct()

zip_nzip = 
  zip_df |>
  pull(zip_code) |>
  n_distinct()
```

There are **149** different ZIP in NYC Rental data and **320** different
ZIP in zip code data. This **171** discrepancy could be explained by
some non-residental ZIP code included in the zip code data and areas
where no house were for rent or the rental was not on Zillow platform.

``` r
avg_rent = zori_final_df |>
  group_by(borough, year(date)) |>
  summarize(mean_price = mean(rent, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = borough,
    values_from = mean_price
  )

kable(avg_rent, caption = "Average Rent by Borough and Year", col.names = c("year", "Bronx", "Brooklyn", "Manhattan", "Queens", "Staten Island"))

Average Rent by Borough and Year

The average rental price increases with time across all boroughs. A
sudden decrease in the price was observed from 2019 to 2020 in Brooklyn,
Manhattan, and Queens. Manhattan has the highest rental price, followed
by Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Bronx.

Max Rent Drop from 2020-2021 by Borough

The rental price in Bronx has almost no changes, while that in other 3
boroughs except Staten Island has dropped from Jan 2020 to Jan 2021. The
drop in Manhattan (**912.5965909**) was much higher than Queens
(**216.9745434**) and Brooklyn (**437.9380917**). No data was available
in Staten Island.

Rental prices increased in the past 10 years. While being higher and
dispersedly distributed in Brooklyn and Manhattan, the rental prices are
more evenly distributed and lower in the other 3 boroughs. Upper
outliers are observed in Manhattan and Queens, meaning some luxury
apartment available. The Staten Island is lack of data prior to 2020.

The plot above shows the average ZIP code level housing price in 2023 in
different state. The five states with the highest median house prices
are **HI** (**8.3253613^{5}**), **CA** (**6.7411982^{5}**), **DC**
(**5.9227819^{5}**), **MA** (**5.3767054^{5}**), **CO**
(**4.8402223^{5}**). Most outlier are found above the boxes, indicating
some luxury houses available. The highest housing price was in **CA**
with a price of **7.6363618^{6}**

Most housing prices are distributed from 500,000 to 1,500,000; most
rental prices range from 2,000 to 4,000. Housing prices and rental
prices are positively correlated.

Limitations:

- Rental price dataset has **27** fewer ZIP code available compared to
  housing price dataset
- Only **8** ZIP code in Staten Island is presented.
- Only housing price in 2023 are available
- Incomplete time coverage for each ZIP code
